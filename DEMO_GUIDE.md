## üìù Voiceover Script Templates

### Option A: Technical
```
"SafeBubble scans Solana tokens in real-time, aggregating data from CoinGecko, 
Helius, and Birdeye. Our enhanced honeypot detection analyzes transaction patterns, 
not just API flags. When a token fails our checks, swaps are blocked. For safe 
tokens, we integrate Jupiter swaps with native Mobile Wallet Adapter‚Äîno browser, 
just your phone and your wallet. Built for Solana Mobile."
```

### Option B: User-Focused
```
"Trading Solana tokens? SafeBubble has your back. We analyze 9 risk factors 
in seconds‚Äîhoneypots, liquidity traps, whale concentration‚Äîand block dangerous 
swaps before you lose money. For safe tokens, swap instantly with Jupiter through 
your mobile wallet. Tap, authenticate, done. This is DeFi security, mobile-first."
```

### Option C: Casual
```
"Ever get rugged on a Solana token? Yeah, us too. So we built SafeBubble. 
It's a live risk scanner that actually blocks you from buying honeypots. Green 
bubble? You're good‚Äîswap with one tap. Red bubble? Our system detected issues 
and won't let you trade. Mobile Wallet Adapter keeps it secure. No more rug pulls."

# 🫧 SafeBubble - Ready for Judge Testing

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Wallet Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Wallet connection was not persisting between screens
- **Solution**: Created `WalletContext` with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Result**: Wallet stays connected across the entire app

### 2. Swap Transaction Issues
- **Problem**: Transactions were failing with unclear error messages
- **Solution**: Added better error handling and user-friendly messages
- **Result**: Clear feedback for insufficient SOL, user cancellation, etc.

### 3. Missing SOL Balance
- **Problem**: Users didn't know they needed SOL for transaction fees
- **Solution**: Added helpful messages and better error handling
- **Result**: Users are informed they need SOL for fees
